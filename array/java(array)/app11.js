//11. Write a program to store 3 student names in an array. Take 
 //   another array to store score of these three students. Assume 
//    that total marks are 500 for each student, display the scores & 
 //   percentages of students like:

//task-11

//number/total*100

const total = 500;

console.log(total);
const names = ["michael" , "tony" , "john"];

console.log(names);
const marks = ["250" , "400" , "310"];

console.log(marks);

var nums = total / marks ;
//console.log(nums);
