    <p>13. The Lifetime Supply Calculator: Ever wonder how
        much a “lifetime supply” of your favorite snack is? 
        Wonder no more.
        a. Store your favorite snack into a variable.
        b. Store your current age into a variable.
        c. Store a maximum age into a variable.
        d. Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
        e. Calculate how many would you eat total for the rest of
        your life.
        Output the result to the screen like so: “You will need 
        NNNN to last you until the ripe old age of NN”.
