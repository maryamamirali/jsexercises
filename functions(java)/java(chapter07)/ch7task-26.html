    <p>26.	The Age Calculator
        Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!
        •	Write a function named calculateAge that:
        o	takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
        o	calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
        o	outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
        •	Call the function three times with different sets of values.
        •	Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.
        </p>
